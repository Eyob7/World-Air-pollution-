# World-Air-pollution-
Air pollution is perceived as a modern-day curse: a by-product of increasing urbanization and industrialization. It does, however, have a long and evolving history with interesting transitions in line with economic, technological and political change. This entry presents a global-level overview of air pollution: trends in emissions from historical through to the present day, the health and mortality burden and risk from air pollution, and discussion of some of the key correlations and determinants of the severity of pollution and its impacts.
Air pollution occurs in indoor (e.g. household) contexts and outdoor environments—this data entry focuses on ambient outdoor pollution. 

Air pollution can be defined as the emission of harmful substances to the atmosphere. This broad definition therefore encapsulates a number of pollutants, including:

•	sulphur dioxide (SO2),

•	nitrogen oxides (NOx),

•	ozone (O3),

•	particulate matter (small suspended particles of varying sizes),

•	carbon monoxide (CO)

•	and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases are not typically considered within this category and are treated separately on Our World In Data.

Disentangling the specific air pollutants—and clearly attributing them to a specific health or environmental outcome—can be complex since some pollutants act as pre-cursors to others. For example, SO2 and NOx can react in the Earth’s atmosphere to form particulate matter (PM) compounds. The sources of each pollutant vary, however, most are generally linked to fuel combustion and industrial activities; pollutants are released as by-products of these processes.

Air pollution has a range of negative impacts, including human health, damage to ecosystems, food crops and the built environment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to human health (note that this is based on current risk- longer-term environmental threats, such as climate change, may exceed this in the future). It’s estimated to be the cause of seven million premature deaths every year (4.3 million from ambient outdoor pollution, and 2.6 from households).1
